        <strong>Instructions</strong>
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and saut√© over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; stir intermittently.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.
        </li>
         <li>
            Add the garlic, turmeric, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir frequently.
        </li>
         <li>
            Add the curry paste, coconut milk, carrots, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 5 minutes,
             or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly.
        </li>
         <li>
            Add the spinach, pepper, and stir until the spinach has wilted.
        </li>
         <li>
            Taste the curry and add the optional but recommended lime juice (brightens the flavor of the dish),
             cilantro, optional light brown sugar (balances the heat), optional salt (I did not add any because the curry paste has salt in it),
             and add extra of any of the spices already used or more curry paste, if desired and to taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
